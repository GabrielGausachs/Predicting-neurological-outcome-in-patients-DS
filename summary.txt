Project Goals (Recap and Clarification):

Predict Neurological Outcome: Build a machine learning model to accurately predict whether a patient with postanoxic encephalopathy will have a "good" (CPC 1-2) or "poor" (CPC 3-5) neurological outcome based on EEG features.
Achieve High Specificity:
For predicting "poor" outcome, the model must have 100% specificity (no false positives). This is crucial to avoid falsely labeling a patient as having a poor outcome.
For predicting "good" outcome, the model must have at least 95% specificity.
Generate ROC Curves with Confidence Intervals: Evaluate model performance using ROC curves and provide confidence intervals to assess the reliability of the results.
Identify Important Features: Determine which EEG features are most predictive of neurological outcome.
Analyze Temporal Changes: Investigate how prediction accuracy changes when using EEG data from 12 hours vs. 24 hours post-cardiac arrest and explain these changes from a neurophysiological perspective.
Approach:

Data Loading and Preprocessing:
Load the featuresNEW 12hrs.xls and featuresNEW 24hrs.xls files using Python libraries like pandas.
Handle missing values appropriately (e.g., imputation with mean/median or removal).
Convert the "Patient Outcome" column into a binary target variable (0 for poor, 1 for good).
Scale or normalize the features to ensure they are on a similar scale.
Address class imbalance. Because the amount of good outcomes could be vastly different than poor outcomes, it is important to balance the data, using oversampling, undersampling, or SMOTE.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Calculate descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, etc.) for each feature.
Visualize feature distributions (histograms, box plots) to identify outliers or unusual patterns.
Create a correlation matrix and heatmap to understand relationships between features.
Analyze the distribution of the target variable to assess class imbalance.
Feature Selection:
Filter Methods:
Correlation: Calculate the correlation between each feature and the target variable. Select features with high absolute correlation.
Variance Thresholding: Remove features with low variance, as they may not provide much predictive information.
Mutual Information: Measures the dependency between two variables. It can capture non-linear relationships.
Wrapper Methods:
Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE): Train a model and recursively remove the least important features until the desired number of features is reached.
Sequential Feature Selection (SFS): Iteratively add or remove features based on model performance.
Embedded Methods:
L1 Regularization (Lasso): Penalizes feature weights, effectively performing feature selection by shrinking some coefficients to zero.
Tree-based Feature Importance: Random Forests and Gradient Boosting Machines provide feature importance scores based on how much each feature contributes to the model's performance.
Model Training and Evaluation:
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Train multiple models (e.g., Random Forests, SVM, Gradient Boosting Machines) using the selected features.
Tune hyperparameters using cross-validation to optimize model performance.
Generate ROC curves and calculate AUC (Area Under the Curve) for each model.
Calculate confidence intervals for the ROC curves using bootstrapping.
Calculate the specificity of the models, and ensure that the project constraints are met.
Temporal Analysis:
Train and evaluate models separately using the 12-hour and 24-hour datasets.
Compare the performance of the models across the two time points.
Analyze the differences in feature importance between the 12-hour and 24-hour models.
Provide neurophysiological explanations for the observed changes in prediction accuracy and feature importance.
Reporting and Presentation:
Document the entire process, including data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation.
Create clear and informative visualizations (ROC curves, feature importance plots).
Prepare a presentation summarizing the findings and conclusions.
Feature Selection Techniques (Detailed):

Correlation:
Pros: Simple and computationally efficient.
Cons: Only captures linear relationships.
Mutual Information:
Pros: Can capture non-linear relationships.
Cons: Can be computationally intensive.
Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE):
Pros: Effective in selecting relevant features.
Cons: Can be computationally expensive.
L1 Regularization (Lasso):
Pros: Performs feature selection during model training.
Cons: May not be suitable for all models.
Tree-based Feature Importance:
Pros: Provides feature importance scores as a byproduct of model training.
Cons: The importance scores can be biased towards features with high cardinality.
Best Feature Selection Approach:

A good approach is to use a combination of methods. Start with filter methods to remove irrelevant features, and then use wrapper or embedded methods to further refine the feature set. For example, use correlation and variance thresholding to initially reduce the number of features, then use Random Forest feature importance or RFE to select the most relevant features.

By following this approach, you can build a robust model that meets the project goals and provides valuable insights into the prediction of neurological outcomes in postanoxic encephalopathy patients.


STEPS:

- Get acces to the data and read it
- Read the papers: (which techniques they use, which types of models,...)
- Analyse the dataset:
    - feature by feature: mean, variance,..
    - handle missing values or/and imbalance
    - target outcome to categorical variable
    - scale/normalize the features
    - visualize feature distributions: histogram, boxplots,... (just to see outliers and
    it is always good to provide some plots about our data)
    - Create a correlation matrix and heatmap to understand relationships between features.
    - Feature selection!!
- Then, its time for choosing the right model, training, cross validation,....
- Evaluate the performance (accuracy, precision, recall, confusion matrix, roc curve, specificity,...)

Additional Info from the newer paper: 

"Further optimization of the selection of EEG measures may
still be possible. The two features that contributed the most to
the classifier are the signal power and Shannon entropy."
